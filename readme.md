# ConnectUs

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/connectus) 

ConnectUs lets you create a p2p network directly from your browser using WebRTC to share Audio/Video stream or raw data using the WebRTC DataChannel API. You can configure the type of p2p network to create in your project or use the f\default server to connect to the main network.

## Getting Started
Install using Node.js

```
npm install connectus
```
OR

Embed the bundled file in your html using

```
<script>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/connectus@1.0.0./</script>
```

Embedding this package will instantly connect the user instance to the global p2p network and will let you stream audio/video or data to peers.
